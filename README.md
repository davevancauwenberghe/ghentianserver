# Welcome on the Ghentian Server repo

## A creative server for Java & Bedrock

Ghentian Server for Minecraft launched in November 2024, offering a 24/7 creative server for both Java & Bedrock editions.

Ghentian Server’s main purpose is to revisit the nostalgia when Minecraft first launched, bringing together friends and fellow Minecrafters while creating and maintaining a fun Minecraft server for all!

The standard game for Ghentian Server has been set to Creative, enabling a cozy building experience. Special game events are held where the server can be set to SMP or even PvP to offer extra layers to the server experience.

## Ghentian Server on Discord
The community comes together in the Ghentian Server Discord Server, feel free to join our Discord and get to know other Minecrafters.

*- PvP events won’t be backupped and restored due to allowed griefing during those events.*
