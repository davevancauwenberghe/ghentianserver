# üè† Ghentian Server Guide

### Welcome to the official Ghentian Server Guide!

This guide will bundle all information about Ghentian Server's features, commands and more!

Ghentian Server is compatible with both Java and Bedrock editions, although Bedrock will lack some features due to compatibility issues through bridging Bedrock to a Java server.

Ghentian Server is a Paper-based server, enabling the usage of several plugins to enhance the gaming experience.

**Joining the server** is easy, add the server address and port and you're good to go.
