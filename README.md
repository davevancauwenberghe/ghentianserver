# üè† Ghentian Server Guide

### Welcome to the official Ghentian Server Guide!

Ghentian Server is an evolving server for Minecraft, aiming to create a thriving community for both builders and miners.

This guide will bundle all information about Ghentian Server's features, commands and more! To help you get the most out of our server experience.

We hope you'll enjoy your time on Ghentian Server! Join the Discord to meet our other players, enter giveaways and more!
