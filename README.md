# üè† Ghentian Server Guide

### Welcome to the official Ghentian Server Guide!

This guide will bundle all information about Ghentian Server's features, commands and more!

Ghentian Server is compatible with both Java and Bedrock editions, although Bedrock will lack some features due to compatibility issues through bridging Bedrock to a Java server.

**Accessing the server** is easy and the server address and/or port and you're good to go.
