# Rulebook

**1. Minecraft EULA**\
Follow the [End User License Agreement](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) of Minecraft.

\
**2. No cracked versions/players allowed**\
To comply with the [Minecraft Usage Guidelines](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines), players attempting to join using a cracked version of Minecraft will be immediately banned from the server.

\
**3. No griefing**\
[Griefing](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Griefing) is not allowed and may result in a (temporary) ban from the server depending on the severity.\
\
Griefing is only permitted during specific Survival PvP events where the map may be destroyed for fighting or mining purposes.

\
**4. Server events**\
At certain times, special server events may be launched, during which the server mode may be switched to another mode to make the experience more challenging.\
\
In the case of PvP events, the server world will be reverted to its previous version after the event, as griefing is allowed during these events.

\
**5. Be respectful**\
The Minecraft server is accessible to everyone, and all players are free to build. Please refrain from demolishing someone else's build without first obtaining permission via #game-chat from the builder.

\
**6. No spamming or self-promotion**\
Avoid excessive or repetitive messages, and do not promote personal content, services, or products unless explicitly permitted. Promoting your own Minecraft servers is allowed in #off-topic-chat on Discord.

\
**7. No NSFW content**\
To comply with Minecraft's usage guidelines, players sharing NSFW chats will be temporarily muted on the Minecraft server.

\
**8. Respect each other's privacy**\
Do not share personal information about yourself or others. Protect your own privacy and that of other Ghentian Server members.\
\
The Ghentian Server Discord & Minecraft servers cannot be held responsible for theft of personal data such as banking or identity information, as this data is not processed by the servers.

\
**9. Listen to moderators**\
Our moderators are here to maintain order and ensure everyone has a great time. Follow their instructions and respond promptly to their requests.

\
**10. Report issues**\
If you encounter concerning behavior or inappropriate content, report it immediately to GS Moderator. Letâ€™s work together to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment.

\
**11. Amendments to the rules**\
These rules may be adjusted or revised at any time based on the server's evolution and needs. Members will be informed appropriately and clearly via #announcements.

\
**12. Agreeing to the rules**\
All members who join the server are expected to review these rules. By joining, every member tacitly agrees to abide by them.\
\
If a member disagrees with any updates to the rules, they may request a temporary, non-definitive ban by contacting GS Server Wizard.

\
**13. Have fun!**\
Most importantly, enjoy your time on the Ghentian Server! Share your experiences and skills, learn from others, and contribute positively to our growing community.

\
**Failure to comply with these rules may result in appropriate actions, including warnings, temporary mute, or bans from the Discord and/or Minecraft server(s).**
