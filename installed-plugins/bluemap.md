# BlueMap

Through BlueMap, the Ghentian Server world can be displayed on any device without the need to use the Minecraft Launcher. Active players are shown in real-time, while builds update with a slight delay to avoid overloading the server.

Through BlueMap’s settings, preferences can be customized to suit personal preferences.\
